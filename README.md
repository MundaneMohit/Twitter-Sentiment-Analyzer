# Twitter-Sentiment-Analyzer
I introduce a novel approach for automatically classifying the sentiment of Twitter messages. These messages are classified as either positive or negative with respect to a query term. This is useful for consumers who want to research the sentiment of products before purchase, or companies that want to monitor the public sentiment of their brands. My aim is to provide a utility/service using which a user can analyze how a particular product/trend/”hashtag” has been received by a general populace based on the twitter feed.


Thank you for trying Twitter Sentiment Analyzer.
